Let's now look at
Azure HDInsight. Azure HDInsight is a
low cost Cloud solution that provides technologies
to help you ingest, process and analyze big data. It supports batch processing, data warehousing, IoT
and data science. It includes Apache
Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Kafka, Storm,
and Interactive Query. Hadoop includes Apache Hive, HBase, Spark, and Kafka. Hadoop stores data in
a file system or HDFS, and Spark stores data in memory. The difference in storage makes Spark about 100 times faster. HBase is a NoSQL database
built on Hadoop. It's commonly used
for search engines. HBase offers automatic failover, and Kafka is an open
source platform that's used to compose
data pipelines. It offers message queue
functionality which allows users to publish or subscribe
to real-time data streams. Storm is a distributed real-time streamlining
analytic solution. It supports common
programming languages like Java, C-sharp and Python. Finally, Interactive
Queries allow you to query the state of your stream processing
application without needing to materialize that state to
external databases or storage. Data engineers use hive to run ETL operations
on the data you're ingesting or orchestrate
hive queries in Azure Data Factory. In Hadoop, you use Java and
Python to process big data. Mapper consumes and
analyzes input data. It then emits tuples that
reducer can analyze. Finally, reducer runs
summary operations to create a smaller
combined result set. Spark processes streams
by using Spark Streaming. For machine learning, it uses the 200 pre-loaded Anaconda
libraries with Python. It uses GraphX for
graph computations. Developers can remotely submit and monitor jobs from Spark. Storm supports common
programming languages like Java, C-sharp and Python. For running queries,
Hadoop supports Pig and HiveQL
languages and in Spark, data engineers use Spark SQL. For security Hadoop
supports encryption, Secure Shell or SSH, shared access signatures and Azure Active Directory security.
